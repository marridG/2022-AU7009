### Final Project

+ Codes: [`~/Final Project Railway Track Detection/*`](https://github.com/marridG/2022-AU7009/tree/master/Final%20Project%20Railway%20Track%20Detection)
+ Report: [Markdown](https://github.com/marridG/2022-AU7009/blob/master/Final%20Project%20Railway%20Track%20Detection/report/report.md), [Markdown-Compiled PDF](https://github.com/marridG/2022-AU7009/blob/master/Final%20Project%20Railway%20Track%20Detection/report/report.pdf)
+ Task: For the given videos taken by tachograph cameras installed on tramcars, complete the following tasks:
  + label data for model training & testing;
  + design an algorithm to detect the railway tracks, and visualize;
  + design an algorithm to detect the obstacles (e.g. pedestrians) on the detected railway tracks, and visualize;
  + provide 1-2 results as videos, containing those at day-time and night-time, and each at a minimum length of 10 seconds;
